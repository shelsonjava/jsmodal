# jsModal #
A cross-browser, non-dependent, modal box engine.

The goal of this project is to provide a tool for generating modals which can be ported to any flavor of systems, big, small, short and tall.

Although JS Modal works on its own, it can be combined with libraries such as: Dojo, jQuery, MooTools, Prototype, script\_aculo\_us, Sizzle, etc.


**Key features:**

Easily generate modal boxes using `Modal.open({content: 'Hello Boson!'});`

Settings can be passed to customize the generated modals and the CSS can be easily adapted to suit your desires.

jsModal has been tested and verified to work in:
  * Google Chrome v27.0.1453.110 m (on Windows 8)
  * FireFox v21 (on Windows 8)
  * IE 8 (on Windows XP)
  * IE 8-10 (on Windows 8)
  * Opera v12.15 (on Windows 8)
  * Safari v5.1.7 (on Windows 8)

It's also verified to work in IE 7 (on Windows XP); However, some minor CSS style fixes may be required.
